# Intellij Debugging Quick Start Guide

## Introduction
Welcome! We're going to spend some time learning about the capabilities of the intellij debugger. This will be time well spent so much so that future *you* will want to hop into a time machine propelled to 88mph, go back to today, and give you a BIG thank you for doing this. That's how useful this stuff will become.

Hey now! Then why didn't you just teach us this stuff on day 1 ?!

There's actually a very good reason for this. The role of the debugger is to amplify a programmer's debugging capabilties but certainly not to become a substitute for it. Just like a crippled person heavily relies on crutches, we should never allow the debugger to become your crutch so to speak. 

Your task ( if you choose to accept it ) is to develop enough skill such that you're able to manually step through a program in order to figure out the flow by yourself. Once you've reach this point, then by all means use the debugger as much as you want.

But remember, nothing can substitute good programming intuition!

Ok, so I'll step off my soap box now and end my mini rant.

## Debugging with dogs and humans

An example project has been prepared to help demonstrate various debugging features called "dogs and humans"
